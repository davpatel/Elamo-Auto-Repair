# Elamo-Auto-Repair
This project demonstrates the steps taken to create a relational database for Elamo Auto Repair, a fictional automobile repair company. Each file corresponds to a different phase of the SDLC. I first created a logical schema based on information about the company's business rules and needs. Next, I transformed that logical schema into a physical schema, removing functional dependencies and preparing to implement a PostgreSQL database. The last file shows a large DDL query that successfully creates the final structure of the company's database objects. *Note: Please download the "Physical Schema.pdf" file for a complete view.
